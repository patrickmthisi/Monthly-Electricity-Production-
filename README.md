# Monthly-Electricity-Production

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end ARIMA-based time series forecasting project for electricity production, including model fitting, rolling forecasts, and performance evaluation using RMSE. The following important time series forecasting concepts are explored in this end-to-end project:
1. ARIMA Modeling: The ARIMA model is implemented for forecasting. It involves the identification of the best ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) through an automated search using historical data.
2. Rolling Forecast: 
    - After fitting the model, a rolling forecast method is implemented where predictions are made one step ahead, and the model is updated with the actual values iteratively.
    - Predictions are corrected using a bias term, which helps adjust the model for errors observed during initial predictions.
3. Model Evaluation:
    - The predicted values are compared against the actual values from the validation set.
    - The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric is used to evaluate the performance of the model.
    - The final predictions and actual validation data are plotted for visualization.    
4. Next Steps: We also mention possible improvements such as experimenting with power transformations (e.g., BoxCox) for further performance optimization.
