# Monthly-Electricity-Production
## Project objectives and description:
This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end ARIMA-based time series forecasting project for electricity production, including model fitting, rolling forecasts, and performance evaluation using RMSE. The following important time series forecasting concepts are explored in this end-to-end project:
1. ARIMA Modeling: The ARIMA model is implemented for forecasting. It involves the identification of the best ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) through an automated search using historical data.
2. Rolling Forecast: 
    - After fitting the model, a rolling forecast method is implemented where predictions are made one step ahead, and the model is updated with the actual values iteratively.
    - Predictions are corrected using a bias term, which helps adjust the model for errors observed during initial predictions.
3. Model Evaluation:
    - The predicted values are compared against the actual values from the validation set.
    - The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric is used to evaluate the performance of the model.
    - The final predictions and actual validation data are plotted for visualization.    
4. Next Steps: We also mention possible improvements such as experimenting with power transformations (e.g., BoxCox) for further performance optimization.

## Conclusion and recommendation:
In this end-to-end project, we were able to achieve remarkable performance measured by an RMSE of 3.217, which is comparable to the majority of the work presented on Kaggle for this dataset. For reference, please see https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shenba/time-series-datasets/code. We did not experiment with power transforms such as BoxCox; perhaps that is an extension of the work that can be implemented.
